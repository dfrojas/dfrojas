### 👋 Hi, I'm Diego Fernando Rojas

I’m a software developer. I create experimental tools for automation infrastructure and performance observability — especially around eBPF, distributed systems, and low-level debugging.

#### Currently building:

- 🐋 **[Yubarta](https://github.com/yubarta/yubarta)** – an open-source platform for auto-remediation at scale using alerts (e.g. from Datadog) and custom eBPF scanners
- 🐳 **[bpfluga](https://github.com/dfrojas/bpfluga)** – a CLI tool for generating logs and metrics from eBPF telemetry, producing flamegraphs and actionable observability outputs

#### On this profile you'll mostly find:

- Rust, C, Python projects focused on profiling, automation, and backend systems
- Experiments in infrastructure-as-code, containerization, and AI-assisted remediation
